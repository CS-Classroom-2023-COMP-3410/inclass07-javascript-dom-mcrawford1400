**Memory Matching Game**

- **Requirements**:
    1. Create a card-matching game with a shuffled grid of cards that the user can flip.
    2. Ensure each card has a matching pair and randomize the layout for every game.
    3. Track the number of moves taken by the user and display it on the screen.
    4. Include a timer to track how long the user takes to complete the game.
    5. Provide a restart button to reset the game at any time.

The website should display the cards all face down. When the user clicks on a card, it should flip over to reveal its value. If two cards are flipped and they match, they should remain face up. If they don't match, they should flip back over after a short delay.

**Instructions**:

1. Create a new HTML file and link it to a CSS file for styling and a JS file for functionality.
2. Use JavaScript to create the game logic, including shuffling the cards, tracking moves, and handling the timer.
3. Use CSS to style the cards and the game board, ensuring it looks visually appealing.
4. Test the game thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
5. Once completed, push your code to your GitHub repository.
